Using GNU make wmbubble should compile without changes on any system listed
in SUPPORTED_SYSTEMS file.  If not, feel free to fix it and send me a diff -u.

Check README file for configuration options - you can disable or adjust all
features at run-time by using command-line switches or X resources.

On BSDs, you can do make install as root to install in /usr/local/bin
and give wmbubble proper permissions, or you'll have to give wmbubble
kmem access yourself:

root:~# chown root:kmem wmbubble; chmod g+s wmbubble
