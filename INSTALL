Install instructions:

1. read README
2. make
3. make install (this will put wmbubble in /usr/local/bin)
4. wmbubble &

Using GNU make wmbubble should compile without changes on any system listed
in SUPPORTED_SYSTEMS file.  If not, feel free to fix it and send me a diff -u.

Check README file for configuration options - you can either permanently
disable a feature by editing Makefile and commenting out any of the EXTRA
defines, or disable it at run-time by using command-line switches. Colors
and bubble physics can also be configured through ~/.Xresources file.

On BSDs, you can do make install as root to install in /usr/local/bin
and give wmbubble proper permissions, or you'll have to give wmbubble
kmem access yourself:

root:~# chown root:kmem wmbubble; chmod g+s wmbubble
